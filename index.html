            <p>When you think of organic food, your mind probably goes to fruits and vegetables first. While they may be
                the most common organic offerings, there are also benefits to eating organic dairy, meat, fish, and
                seafood. All of these types of organic food are readily available in grocery stores.</p>

            <p class="blog-para">Organic foods are the ones that are chemical-free and grown using no pesticides or
                chemical fertilizers. Unlike conventional foods, during the production of organic fruits and vegetables,
                no chemicals are used to increase their size or to ripe them before time.</p>

                    Studies show that dark chocolate (not the sugary crap) can improve your health and lower the risk of
                    heart disease. This article reviews 7 health benefits of dark chocolate or cocoa that are supported

                <p>The findings, published in the British Journal of Nutrition in February, conclude that organic meat
                    contains about 50% more beneficial omega-3 fatty acids than conventionally produced meat, and has
                    fewer potentially harmful saturated fatty acids (myristic acid and palmitic acid).</p>
